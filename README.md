# Hi there 👋

Nice to see you. Not that I can actually see you, just nice you're here.

## So who I am?
I am a passionate software engineer, responsible for a lot of projects (see my pinned list for the most significant) and hopefully I can expand it with some more.

You might also know me for making [P-Slice](https://github.com/Psych-Slice/P-Slice), which was able to create a bridge between new functionalities and existing modding systems in the Friday Night Funkin' community.

## Education and work experience 🎓
I am a 2rd-year Practical Computer Science student at the University of Gdańsk. Aside from just studying, I partake in the [L2B2 iniciative](https://l2b2.inf.ug.edu.pl)

In the meantime, I develop my own private projects, with plans to create some commercial as well.
